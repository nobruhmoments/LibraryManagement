# LibraryManagement
### Purpose
LibraryManagement is a program that is going to be able to both store and check out books. Books will be able to be filtered using genres, titles, and authors. Each book will also have a special serial code attached to it, making storing and checking out books much simpler. You will also be able to see the cover and back of the book when looking/checking out a book. You will need a library ID or a library login in order to access the contents of the library.
